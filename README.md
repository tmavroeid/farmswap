## Introduction
The FarmSwap projects consinsts of smart contracts in Solidity offering the following functionality:

- A contract that accepts USDC deposits and rewards the user with FarmCoins.
- If there is no lock up period, the user earns 10% APY in FarmCoin.
- For a six month lock up, the user earns 20% APY in FarmCoin.
- For a 1 year lock up, the user earns 30% APY in FarmCoin.
- In case of lock up, early withdraw incurs a 10% penalty fee to the original amount.

The contracts are written using the **Solidity compiler 0.8.7 version**. In this project the Truffle Suite is utilized in order to run a local blockchain and deploy the smart contracts on top of it. You have to change the pragma version which is used in **Ownable.sol** and **ERC20.sol** to: `pragma solidity 0.8.7;` 

## System Design
The functionality offered by the FarmSwap project is implemented by 4 smart contracts:

- **USDCoin.sol**: This contract is used in the context of this project in order to create an ERC-20 token which mocks USDC tokens.
- **Staking.sol**: This contract contains all the necessary functions that enable staking of USDC, calculating the amount of rewards and the penalty in case of early leave before the lock up period completes. The function *withdrawAmount* returning the **USDC amount**, **penalty** and **reward** will be internal, that is, allowed to be accessed from inside the contract where the **Staking.sol** is inherited and not from outside.
- **FarmSwap.sol**: This contract operates as a controller. It inherits the staking capabilities from the **Staking.sol** and holds the ownership of all FarmCoins created in order to reward the users who stake USDC. This contract also manages USDC deposits and withdraws between a user and its contract address. 
- **FarmCoin.sol**: This contract is used for the creation of an ERC-20 token called FarmCoin which is used to reward users.

The algorithm calculating the rewards is implemented inside the function **calculateStakeReward** in contract **Staking.sol** which is as follows:
- Examining whether a stake has lockup set to True or False.
- Check the lockup_period in order to calculate the rewards per hour rate.
- Calculate the stake duration via (block.timestamp â€” the period of activity of the stake); this duration is calculated in seconds.
- Then the stake duration is divided by 1 hours (Solidity internal variable for 3600 seconds); this is done cause the rewards' rate is also calculated by hour.
- Multiply by the stake amount with the stake duration in hours.
- Divide by the reward per hour rate which is store in a variable.

## Testing

To test the FarmSwap follow the instructions below.

Download the repo, navigate into the root directory of the project and follow the steps below in order to test it:

1. Install dependencies:

``npm install``

2. Open the truffle interactive console that also spawns a development blockchain:

`truffle develop`

3. Then inside the truffle console invoke the test command:

`test`

The last command will compile the contracts and then perform the tests.

### Testing the Smart Contracts
The result of the tests should look like the following:
